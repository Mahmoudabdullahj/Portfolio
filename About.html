            <h1> Hello, I'm Mahmoud Abdullah </h1>
          </div>

          <p>I'm a graphic designer located in Amman, Jordan.
            After studying a diploma in graphic design at The Hashemite University, I worked for three months as an intern, and In 2018 I started my career as a graphic designer with a company called Ivy Hygiene Solutions where I produced all in-house communications including newsletters, brochures, logos, annual reports, educational signage, special events materials, packages, Stickers, and Catalogs. At that time I've found out that Logos, branding, and typography are a few of my favorite things. I spend most of my time learning new things on the internet trying to get the most out of it, things like programming, business, marketing, ads, and many more.
Fun fact this website that you're looking at right now I made it from scratch using programming languages (HTML, CSS) by only taking a free course on Codecademy, and in the meantime I'm studying UI/UX on Coursera because.</p>
